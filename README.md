# Pong-game
## A simple two player pong game. Made with the use of pygam library.
A very basic user friendly and easy to use pong game made with the help of pygame library.
initially I created a paddle class which are used by players to bounce the ball back and forth.
then i defined two objects under this class for two players.
there is also a ball class which holds and defines the attributes of the ball.
Finally the pong.ipynb file is the main file of the program. In which we import both classes and then defines there functions.
